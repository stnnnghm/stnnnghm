Hi there :wave: **I'm Stevan** - I'm a software engineer with a passion for Golang and a few other cool technologies.

### A Little Bit About Me..

My most recent Go projects involved: 
- Maintaining a _golang_ monorepo containing most of the [company's](https://www.bayer.com/en/) scientific data collections :nerd_face:
- Maintaing a dynamic ticketing application for the [largest ticket vendor](https://www.ticketmaster.com/) in the US :robot:
- I've even helped develop a new credit processing platform for an [awesome financial firm](https://www.americanexpress.com/) :credit_card:

Before coding, I was in the US Air Force :us: for 9 years. It left me with a sense of duty, and attention to detail that I believe helps me to be a better developer overall. I enjoy throwing myself into my work, and don't believe in doing things halfway. 

### Work Hard, Play Hard 

My hobbies include: 
- _Coding (duh)_ :desktop_computer:
- _Learning cool stuff_ :telescope:
- _Picking up heavy things at the gym_ :weight_lifting_man:
- _Spending time with my wonderful GF_ :couple_with_heart:
- _Pushing myself through tough obstacles that life has and will continue to present_ :men_wrestling:
