Hi there, **I'm Stevan** - I'm a software engineer with a passion for Golang and a few other cool technologies. My most recent Go project involved maintaining a giant monorepo that contained almost all of the company's scientific collections.. Before that I worked to fight bots at the largest ticket vendor in the US, and I've even developed a new credit card processor for an awesome financial firm.

Before coding, I was in the US Air Force for 9 years. It's instilled a sense of duty, and attention to detail that I believe helps me to be a better developer overall. I enjoy throwing myself into my work, and don't believe in submitting work that does not meet the standard.

I live by the mantra _**'Work Hard, Play Hard'**_. My hobbies include: _**coding (duh), working out, learning cool stuff, and picking up heavy things at the gym**_.
